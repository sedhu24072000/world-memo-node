JWT Authentication: Secure login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to authenticate users.
React Router: Smooth navigation between different pages in the app.
State Management: React Context API is used to manage global state in the app.
Full-Stack Application: Built using React on the frontend and Node.js/Express with MongoDB on the backend.
